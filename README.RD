# 👋 Hi, I’m David

Engineering Lead & Product-Focused Technologist with a strong focus on AI systems, documentation automation, and modern development workflows.  
I help engineering teams move faster, work smarter, and deliver higher-quality software by integrating AI, scalable systems, and clear technical direction.

Currently at **Solidigm**, where I drive AI adoption (MCP + GitHub Copilot), lead cross-functional engineering efforts, and support the redesign and modernization of our corporate web platform.

## 🔭 What I’m Building & Leading

### **🧩 AI + Engineering Automation**
- A Figma plugin that automatically generates **technical wikis**, **architecture summaries**, and **Jira-ready requirements**  
  → turning design artifacts into engineering documentation in seconds.

- Internal AI workflows for:
  - PR review augmentation  
  - Automated documentation  
  - Sprint planning support  
  - Knowledge base generation  
  - Engineering onboarding acceleration

### **🚀 Engineering Leadership**
- Leading engineering strategy for large-scale web modernization at Solidigm  
- Driving adoption of MCP, Copilot, and agent-based tools  
- Guiding offshore teams (engineering, QA, design) to increase delivery velocity  
- Mentoring engineers in architecture, automation, and standards

### **📦 Product Development**
- Building lightweight AI-driven tools that help teams automate repetitive workflows  
- Exploring frameworks for “instant documentation” and “zero-effort process compliance”  
- Experimenting with developer productivity products using AI, TypeScript, and automation pipelines

## 📌 Featured Projects

### **Figma → Wiki Automation Plugin (WIP)**
Transforms designs into:
- Jira tickets  
- Technical specs  
- Release notes  
- Component documentation  
- Acceptance criteria  

Bridges the gap between design, product, and engineering.

### **AI-Driven Documentation & Review Agent**
Local agent that can:
- Analyze PRs  
- Generate technical summaries  
- Flag architectural issues  
- Draft documentation automatically  

### **System Responsiveness Analyzer**
Tool for detecting:
- px-value debt  
- breakpoints issues  
- design inconsistencies  
- fluid/responsive improvements  

Originally used for Solidigm’s V3 redesign initiative.
