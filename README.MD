# David Smith

Engineering Manager and Technical Lead focused on building systems, improving workflows, and helping teams deliver with clarity and consistency. I operate at the intersection of engineering, product, and design, and I spend most of my time working on the processes, documentation, and technical direction that enable teams to move faster with fewer surprises.

My background spans front-end architecture, documentation automation, legacy platform modernization, design systems, and cross-functional leadership. I’m currently leading engineering initiatives at Solidigm, a SK hynix company, while developing internal tools that support technical documentation and design-to-engineering workflows.

## Current Work

### Figma → Technical Documentation Automation
I’m developing a Figma plugin that generates structured engineering artifacts from design files—technical wikis, Jira requirement drafts, change summaries, and handoff documentation. The goal is to reduce the time engineers and PMs spend writing repeatable documents and to create a consistent, predictable workflow between design and engineering.  
This tool integrates MCP, structured prompt pipelines, and internal conventions.

### AI and MCP Adoption at Solidigm
I’m helping engineering and product teams adopt MCP workflows, GitHub Copilot, and other practical AI tools. This includes training, workflow design, and introducing real processes for AI-assisted requirement writing, code review augmentation, documentation generation, and internal developer tools.

### Corporate Website Modernization (Technical Lead)
I lead the engineering team responsible for Solidigm’s corporate site, including the redesign and modernization of the platform. Focus areas include performance, SEO, responsive architecture, content systems, AEM component updates, design tokens, accessibility, and the alignment between design, product, and engineering.  
This work involves both hands-on engineering and managing execution across an offshore team.

## How I Work

I tend to focus on:
- Creating structure around ambiguous requirements  
- Translating product goals into clear technical direction  
- Improving documentation, both internal and customer-facing  
- Building automated tools that replace repetitive work  
- Designing scalable component and layout systems  
- Strengthening communication between product, design, and engineering  
- Ensuring teams have the context and clarity they need to execute well  

My role often combines engineering leadership with product-level thinking—planning, clarifying priorities, managing tradeoffs, and establishing systems that outlast individuals.

## Experience Summary

- Lead a cross-functional engineering team (engineers, QA, design, scrum)  
- Modernize legacy codebases, dispatchers, and front-end platforms  
- Build internal developer tools and documentation systems  
- Manage cross-functional planning and engineering roadmaps  
- Work across marketing engineering, product requirements, and design integration  
- Simplify processes for teams working in AEM, design systems, or distributed environments  

My path started with early HTML/CSS experiments on Myspace, moved through a Computer Science degree at Sonoma State University, and grew through roles at UC Davis and Madison Logic where I built internal tools, systemized documentation, and modernized large marketing engineering platforms.

## What I'm Exploring

- AI-supported engineering workflows that reduce repetitive work  
- Design → engineering automation for large organizations  
- Better documentation systems for teams working across product and design  
- Scalable architectures for marketing platforms on AEM  
- Ways to turn technical clarity into a predictable, repeatable process
